# OpenAlgo Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Project:** OpenAlgo
**Scope:** Full codebase audit.
**Focus:** Identify vulnerabilities common in open-source, multi-contributor projects, with a specific emphasis on SQL Injection, Input Validation, and Dependency Management.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This security audit of the OpenAlgo platform was conducted to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities based on the current state of the codebase. The platform maintains a solid security foundation with robust authentication and session management. However, several high-risk areas persist that require immediate attention to mitigate potential exploitation, especially in an open-source context.

The most significant risks continue to be:
1.  **Inadequate Input Validation:** Allowing non-numeric or improperly formatted data into core application logic.
2.  **Potential for SQL Injection:** Risk of un-sanitized inputs being used in database queries.
3.  **Lack of Automated Dependency Scanning:** Exposing the platform to known vulnerabilities in third-party packages.

Recent codebase simplification, including the removal of a broker integration, has positively reduced the overall attack surface. Nonetheless, the foundational risks remain and should be the primary focus of security improvement efforts.

## 2. Summary of Findings

| Category                  | Status & Key Findings                                                                                                   | Priority Recommendations                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Validation**      | **High Risk.** API schemas and data processing functions often use generic `string` types for numeric or structured data, bypassing crucial validation. | **High:** Refactor all Marshmallow/WTF schemas to use strict types (`fields.Int`, `fields.Float`) and add validators (e.g., `validate.Range`). |
| **SQL Injection Risk**    | **High Risk.** The potential for using raw or improperly parameterized queries in database interactions persists.                  | **Critical:** Mandate the use of an ORM (like SQLAlchemy Core expressions) for all database queries. Enforce this during code reviews. |
| **Dependency Management** | **High Risk.** No automated process to scan `requirements.txt` and `package.json` for packages with known vulnerabilities. | **High:** Integrate `pip-audit` and `npm audit` into the CI/CD pipeline to block vulnerable dependencies from being merged. |
| **Authentication**        | **Good.** Strong hybrid model for API keys (Argon2 + Fernet) and secure session management for the UI.                   | **Low:** No immediate recommendations.                                                                                   |
| **Sensitive Data Storage**| **Good.** Broker credentials and API keys are encrypted at rest.                                                        | **Medium:** Ensure the `API_KEY_PEPPER` is rotated periodically and managed securely, ideally not just in an `.env` file for production. |
| **Security Headers**      | **Medium Risk.** Content Security Policy (CSP) is present but weakened by the use of `'unsafe-inline'`.                   | **Medium:** Refactor frontend code to remove inline scripts and styles, allowing for a stricter CSP without `'unsafe-inline'`. |
| **Error Handling**        | **Good.** Custom error pages prevent stack trace leakage to end-users.                                                  | **Low:** Review logs to ensure sensitive data is not being inadvertently logged in error messages.                     |

## 3. Detailed Analysis & Recommendations

### 3.1. Input Validation

**Vulnerability:**
Many API endpoints accept data where numeric fields (e.g., `quantity`, `price`) are defined as simple strings. This prevents essential validation (e.g., checking for positive numbers) and can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes if non-numeric data is submitted.

**Recommendation (High):**
1.  **Use Strict Data Types:** Refactor all Marshmallow schemas and WTForms to use specific field types like `fields.Integer`, `fields.Float`, and `fields.Decimal`.
2.  **Implement Validators:** Add validators to these fields to enforce business logic, such as `validate.Range(min=0)` for quantities and prices.
3.  **Reject Invalid Requests:** Configure endpoints to immediately return a `400 Bad Request` response if the input does not match the schema's validation rules.

### 3.2. SQL Injection

**Vulnerability:**
The codebase structure allows for the possibility of database queries being constructed using string formatting. This practice is highly vulnerable to SQL Injection, where a malicious actor could manipulate a query to access or modify data.

**Recommendation (Critical):**
1.  **Mandate ORM Usage:** Enforce a strict policy that all database interactions must go through the SQLAlchemy ORM or its Core expression language to ensure proper parameterization.
2.  **Code Review Check:** Make it a mandatory part of the pull request review process to reject any code that uses raw, string-formatted SQL queries.

### 3.3. Dependency Management

**Vulnerability:**
The project relies on third-party libraries and lacks an automated system to scan them for known security vulnerabilities (CVEs). A malicious or outdated dependency could introduce a severe security hole.

**Recommendation (High):**
1.  **Integrate Automated Scanning:** Add `pip-audit` (for Python) and `npm audit` (for Node.js) to the CI/CD pipeline.
2.  **Fail Builds on Vulnerabilities:** Configure the CI pipeline to fail if a dependency with a 'High' or 'Critical' vulnerability is detected.
3.  **Establish an Update Policy:** Create a regular schedule to review and update dependencies.
