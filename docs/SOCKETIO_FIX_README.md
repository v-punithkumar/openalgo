# Socket.IO Session Disconnection Error Fix

## Problem
The error `KeyError: 'Session is disconnected'` occurs when Socket.IO clients disconnect abruptly and the server still tries to handle requests for that disconnected session. This is a common issue in production environments but doesn't affect the application's functionality.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Socket.IO Error Handler** (`utils/socketio_error_handler.py`)
- Created error handlers that catch Socket.IO disconnection errors gracefully
- Provides a decorator for handling disconnected sessions in event handlers
- Logs disconnection events at debug level instead of error level
- Uses Flask-SocketIO's built-in error handling system

### 2. **Enhanced Socket.IO Configuration** (`extensions.py`)
- Disabled verbose Socket.IO and Engine.IO logging to reduce noise
- Added ping timeout and interval settings for better connection management
- Configured for threading mode to avoid eventlet conflicts

### 3. **Gunicorn Configuration Updates** (`start.sh`)
- Added graceful timeout settings for better handling of long-running connections
- Set log level to warning to filter out non-critical messages
- Added timeout configurations to prevent hanging connections

## How to Apply the Fix

### For Docker Users:

1. **Rebuild the Docker image:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Or if using plain Docker:**
```bash
docker build -t openalgo:latest .
docker run -d --name openalgo-web -p 5000:5000 -p 8765:8765 openalgo:latest
```

### For Non-Docker Users:

The changes will take effect after restarting the application:
```bash
# Stop the current application
pkill -f gunicorn

# Restart with updated configuration
gunicorn --worker-class gthread --workers 1 --threads 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --timeout 120 --graceful-timeout 30 --log-level warning app:app
```

## What Changed

1. **New File:** `utils/socketio_error_handler.py` - Error handlers and decorators for Socket.IO
2. **Modified:** `app.py` - Added initialization of Socket.IO error handler
3. **Modified:** `extensions.py` - Enhanced Socket.IO configuration with better error handling
4. **Modified:** `start.sh` - Updated Gunicorn settings for better connection management

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- The `KeyError: 'Session is disconnected'` errors will no longer appear in logs
- Disconnection events will be logged at debug level only
- The application will continue to function normally without crashes
- Socket.IO connections will be managed more efficiently

## Monitoring

To monitor Socket.IO connections after applying the fix, you can check the logs:

```bash
# For Docker users
docker logs openalgo-web

# Check only warnings and errors
docker logs openalgo-web 2>&1 | grep -E "WARNING|ERROR"
```

## Notes

- This fix doesn't prevent disconnections (which are normal), it just handles them gracefully
- The error was cosmetic and didn't affect functionality, but the fix improves log clarity
- The ping timeout and interval settings help detect disconnected clients faster
